# Project_on_IRIS_Flower_Prediction
1 INTRODUCTION :
Classification of plants and flowers is an important task in botany and biology. Traditional methods rely on manual observation of morphological features, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. With the advancement of machine learning, it is possible to automate this classification process using computational models. The Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher, is one of the most widely used datasets in pattern recognition and machine learning research.


2 Motivation :
The project aims to automate iris flower classification, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. It also provides hands-on experience with supervised learning, predictive modeling, and data analysis.


3 Technologies Used :
* Python – programming language
* Pandas & NumPy – data handling and calculations
* Scikit-learn – logistic regression and evaluation
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualisation

  
4 Scope of the Project :
* Build a model to predict iris species accurately
* Preprocess and visualize data
* Evaluate model using accuracy and confusion matrix
* Serve as a foundation for exploring other ML algorithms in biological datasets
